Selecting specific single col or multiple col values from db table or records is called scalar operations or working with projection.

-> The finder methods of spring data jpa supports two types of projections:
	(1) Static Projections: Allows to select fixed coloum values (Single or Multiple)
	(2) Allows to select specific varying column values (Single or Multiple)
	
-> Working with static Projections:
	While dealing with Entity Queries which select all coloum values we can store each records to the object of entity class
	but while working with scalar queries we need define certain type to hold specific single or multiple coloum values.
	That is Custome Interface having declaration of getter methods for our choice single or multiple properties.
	
	Step-1) Define one Type Interface having getter methods of specific single or multiple properties.
	Step-2) Declare finder method in the Repository invloving the above type interface in the return type.
	Step-3) Define method in service class.
